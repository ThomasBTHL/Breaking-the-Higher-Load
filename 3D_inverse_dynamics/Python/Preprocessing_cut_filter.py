"""
This program is part of the preprocessing motion capture data.
1) Determine ball_pickups and save into markers
2) Filter the markers and save as markersFilter
3) Save all 4 configurations of filtered / cut

In this function you can use three plot functions, these can be found in functions.py:
1) visual_check_markers('RUS', 'RRS', 'RMHE', 'RLHE', markers)
2) visual_check_smoothing_effect(markerName, coordinateName, markers, markersNew)
